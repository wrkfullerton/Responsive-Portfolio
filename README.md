# William Fullerton: Responsive Portfolio


This is a reponsive portfolio, that has information about me, my company - Watermark Ventures, and some of the work that I have done for the coding bootcamp thus far. 

On the home/about page - you will find information about me, my background with links to my linkedin page and a button that will bring you to the contact page. 

You will find my company, Watermark Ventures. A video and a button that will bring you to an early version of my webpage - www.watermark.ventures

# Portfolio Page

On this page - I will continue to update it with the work that we do in class and for assignments. I have included the Horiseon Website Code Refactor exercise and the Rock Paper Scissors game that we coded with groups and with instructors. I went through after class and recoded the exercise following the Rock Paper Scissors solution file. But thought that it was still novel enough to include it within the portfolio page.

I have included a random password generator and "stockstalker" and there associated GitHub Repo's.

# Contact Page

I have included a contact page with my email and cell-phone number - I also tried to embed a PHP file/element. But understand we will likely learn how to link those things later on to make it useable.
